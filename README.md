# Brownian-Motion-Simulation-

This project is about simulating the price of a financial asset using a Brownian motion model.  
I worked on this project to better understand how asset prices move over time and how uncertainty affects financial markets.

# Why I did this project
I wanted to learn the basics of quantitative finance and see how mathematical models are used to represent market behavior.  
This project helped me understand the role of expected return and volatility in asset price movements.

# What I did
I used a geometric Brownian motion model to simulate the price of an asset over one year with daily time steps.  
The model includes a trend representing the expected return and a random part representing market fluctuations.

# Tools
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

# Result
The program generates one possible price path of the asset.  
Each simulation can give a different result, which shows how unpredictable financial markets can be.

# Final note
This project is not meant to predict future prices.  
It is only a learning project to understand asset price behavior and prepare for more advanced quantitative finance topics.
